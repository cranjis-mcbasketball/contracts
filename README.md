# Overview
This repository represents my ongoing efforts to integrate croncat tasks into our art auction [webapp](https://www.municipalartregistry.org/) using the variables we have in our [Master Art Plan](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qGkGjxh247AT6VS3cRsv2j4H7C5wyKms/view?usp=sharing). 

These tasks will help manage processes in our online real world auctions including but limited to: 
- bidding
- NEAR cryptocurrency exchange
- granting artists ownership of when to call the auctioning of their work
